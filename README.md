=================================

This Ansible content will configure a Windows Server 2019 machine to be GSA compliant.

This role **will make changes to the system** that could impact its performance and/or availability.

For configuration compliance auditing, use a tool such as [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) or [CIS-CAT](https://learn.cisecurity.org/cis-cat-lite)

This hardening content is based on the GSA Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Security Benchmark v1.0 and the [CIS Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Benchmark v1.1.0 ](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/).
